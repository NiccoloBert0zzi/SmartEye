**SmartEye** is an innovative project that combines the use of an advanced camera and a projector to create an interactive interface based on hand movements. With SmartEye, users can interact with a range of functionalities projected onto a flat surface, eliminating the need for traditional physical devices.

The project represents a new frontier in user interface design, enabling seamless and natural interaction with digital tools through simple hand gestures.

# Main Features

1. **🧮 Interactive Calculator**
   - SmartEye projects a virtual calculator onto a surface. Users can perform calculations simply by moving their hands to select numbers and operations. Forget the need for a physical device: everything you need is projected right in front of you.

2. **🖨️ Thermal Scanner**
   - Thanks to SmartEye's technology, it can detect and visualize the temperature of specific objects or areas. This thermal scanner projects a thermal map onto the surface, allowing users to analyze temperature variations in real time through the object's ability to emit or absorb light.

3. **📐 Object Size Measurement**
   - With SmartEye, you can measure the dimensions of physical objects without the need for a ruler. The camera detects the object's edges and calibrates itself using an Aruco marker, while the projector displays the measurements directly on the surface, providing a practical and precise method for measuring anything.

4. **🔎 Object Recognition**
   - SmartEye is equipped with an AI-based object recognition system. Once an object is identified, the projector displays its name on the object. This tool is ideal for educational and instructional applications.

5. **🚀 Space Invader Game**
   - Turn any surface into a space battlefield with the interactive Space Invader game. Move your hands to control your spaceship and defeat waves of alien invaders. An immersive gaming experience that will make you forget you're not using a physical controller.

6. **🎨 Drawing Board**
   - Unleash your creativity with the interactive drawing board feature. By using hand movements, you can draw and write directly on the projected surface. Ideal for quick sketches, notes, or simply having fun drawing.

## 👩🏻‍💻 How It Works
SmartEye uses an advanced camera to monitor and interpret hand movements in real-time. These movements are then translated into commands that activate the system's various functionalities. The projector, positioned above the work surface, displays the interfaces of different applications directly onto the surface, creating a smooth and intuitive user experience.

# Installation and Configuration

1. **⚙️ Hardware Requirements**
   - High-resolution camera with motion detection capabilities.
   - Projector with compatible resolution.
   - Clear, flat projection surface (e.g., table, desk).

2. **🛠️ Setup**
   - Mount the camera and projector so they are aimed at the desired surface.
   - Configure the camera to correctly detect hand movements.
   - Ensure the projector is calibrated to project the image onto the correct area.

3. **📜 Getting Started**
   - Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/SmartEye.git`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd SmartEye`
   - Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Run  `HandCalibration.py` the projector calibration (in the calibration folder), which will generate a `M.npy` file.
   - Start the system: `python main.py`
